Welcome to the Helix drone project!

This project aims to use the Raspberry Pi 3 to control all hardware on a self-deployed Quadrotor drone.
The project is a "learning experience" and comes together with a manual describing the different technologies and coding principles needed.

The manual can be given upon request, but will also be uploaded here once it reaches its first draft state.
